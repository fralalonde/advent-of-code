# Advent of Code 2018

`User 'fralalonde' has left the game.`

Yes, this is an official Advent of Code **rage quit**.

I'm cutting my losses as the game turns into _Advent of Mildly Obfuscated Brain Teasers_.
I came here to pump code and burn machine cycles, goddammit!
Besides, I have [other](https://github.com/fralalonde/dipstick) [projects](https://github.com/fralalonde/microbrust) to work on, not to mention finishing the basement.

Props to [@tokenrove](https://github.com/tokenrove), [@programble](https://github.com/programble/), [@josepot](https://github.com/josepot) and [@voliva](https://github.com/voliva) who I felt I was competing with for a while.

As for Santa's elves, let them drink concrete and sink through the ice sheet.
We all know who'll be paying the bill come January.

Solutions to the 2018 edition [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

All problems solved using stable [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with minimal dependencies (`regex` and `linked_list`).

All code and ideas here are from my head, as shitty or misguided they may be.
Except for my day 13 solution which I thought was [pretty nifty](https://github.com/fralalonde/aoc-2018/blob/master/13/src/main.rs).

You may hereby pilfer whatever you wish from this repo and claim it your own.
